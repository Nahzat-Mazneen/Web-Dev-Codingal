  <h1 class="display-1" style=color:green;>Periodic Table</h1>
  <p style=color:blue;>The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of the elements, is an ordered arrangement of the chemical elements into rows ("periods") and columns ("groups"). It is an icon of chemistry and is widely used in physics and other sciences. It is a depiction of the periodic law, which states that when the elements are arranged in order of their atomic numbers an approximate recurrence of their properties is evident. The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas called blocks. Elements in the same group tend to show similar chemical characteristics.

    <small class="text-muted" >Vertical, horizontal and diagonal trends characterize the periodic table. Metallic character increases going down a group and from right to left across a period. Nonmetallic character increases going from the bottom left of the periodic table to the top right.</small>

    The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of <mark style=color:fuchsia>the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869;</mark> he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on atomic mass. As not all elements were then known, there were gaps in his periodic table, and Mendeleev successfully used the periodic law to predict some properties of some of the missing elements. The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century. It was explained early in the 20th century, with the discovery of atomic numbers and associated pioneering work in quantum mechanics, both ideas serving to illuminate the internal structure of the atom. A recognisably modern form of the table was reached in <mark style=color:fuchsia>1945 with Glenn T. </mark>Seaborg's discovery that the actinides were in fact f-block rather than d-block elements. The periodic table and law are now a central and indispensable part of modern chemistry.

    The periodic table continues to evolve with the progress of science. In nature, only elements up to atomic number 94 exist;[a] to go further, it was necessary to synthesize new elements in the laboratory. By 2010, the first <mark style=color:fuchsia>118 </mark>elements were known, thereby completing the first seven rows of the table;[1] however, chemical characterization is still needed for the heaviest elements to confirm that their properties match their positions. New discoveries will extend the table beyond these seven rows, though it is not yet known how many more elements are possible; moreover, theoretical calculations suggest that this unknown region will not follow the patterns of the known part of the table. Some scientific discussion also continues regarding whether some elements are correctly positioned in today's table. Many alternative representations of the periodic law exist, and there is some discussion as to whether there is an optimal form of the periodic table.</p><br>
  <h1 class=display-2 style=color:green>About Some Elements</h1>
  <p>With these elements we proceed Chemical Reactions those give us new substances . Some of are <mark>Hydrogen,Helium,Lithium,Beryllium,Boron,Carbon</mark>etc...These elements mixed with each other give new things that we use in our whole life.The result of this reaction can be food,electricity,washing liquids etc...We can see some reaction's results: </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Hydrogen and Oxygen</dt>
    <dd> <p style=color:navy>H<sub>2</sub>O</p></dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>Hydrogen,Sulfer and Oxygen</dt>
   <dd> <p style=color:navy>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p></dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>Sodium,Sulfer and Oxygen</dt>
    <dd> <p style=color:navy>Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub></p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>We can see in Periodic Table there are some characteristics of these element's. Reasearches about subtances are conducted by <abbr title="Inernational Union of Pure and Applied Chenistry">IUPAC</abbr>.</p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p style=color:green>Bootstrap (formerly Twitter Bootstrap) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

  As of May 2023, Bootstrap is the 17th most starred project (4th most starred library) on GitHub, with over 164,000 stars.[4] According to W3Techs, Bootstrap is used by 19.2% of all websites.[5]</p></blockquote>

  <p style=color:brown>In Bootsrap we need put a div with container tag like <code>div class="container"</code>.and if we put a div with row tag like <code>div class="row"</code> ....</p>
  <p><b>We can power a number in bootsrap through <code>sup</code> tag:<br>
